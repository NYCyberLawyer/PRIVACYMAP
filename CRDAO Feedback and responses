Direct failure response received from CRDAO, details: 

My recommendation for 58

1:2 - PRIVACY MAPPING APPLICATION: Direct Fail 
- No build or test running instructions on the README (added on main repo Read Me) 

https://github.com/NYCyberLawyer/PRIVACYMAP/blob/main/README.md

- No usage documentation (added on main repo Read Me) 

https://github.com/NYCyberLawyer/PRIVACYMAP/blob/main/README.md

- No description (expanded on the readme file and licensing)


https://github.com/NYCyberLawyer/PRIVACYMAP/blob/main/README.md

https://github.com/NYCyberLawyer/PRIVACYMAP/blob/main/LICENSE


- High-severity security vulnerabilities in their dependencies (Ran CodeQL and verified all vulnerabilities and dependencies)

Also Code scanning active and automated to run.


- Repo looks like folders pasted together for submission, rather than a coherent/living project 

This was a migration from one of developers and it was verified and fixed upon feedback and gudelines from grant DXD #158


- No CI or static analysis (One folder has some GH actions but inactive because it is just a pasted folder) 

Remediated the old file on GH actions and Code scanning active and automated to run.


- No proper API docs other than the docx file uploaded to the repo, which is not ideally following the common practices (new API doc with examples and expected outcomes)

https://github.com/NYCyberLawyer/PRIVACYMAP/blob/main/api/README.md

- No contribution or security policy I highly suggest for the OP to examine the repositories of well-known open source projects on GitHub, and study the DxD grant #185.

Secuirty policy - https://github.com/NYCyberLawyer/PRIVACYMAP/security/policy

New documentation based on feedback - https://github.com/NYCyberLawyer/PRIVACYMAP/blob/main/README.md
