# Milestone 2 - API Build

The deliverable in this stage will involve the integration of automated processes within the data flow mapping process.  With the identification of different data sets throughout the organization, users will be provided the opportunity to connect all sources via API to a core repository within the data privacy mapping dashboard. For example, the User may be able to connect an API from their cloud server that can show server location at any one time and be matched to the data type on that server. This data, hosted by the business itself,  will not only illustrate the origin, processing, and destination of each piece of private data within the organization, but will also provide the basis for any additional privacy activities (e.g. consent management).

Acceptance criteria: Please enter the specific details on what the deliverable must do to prove this milestone is complete.
Acceptance criteria would consist of the delivery of the following items:
- API Integration Function - API Integration capabilities. 
- Repository Module - Secure Data Repository Accessible illustrating data, location, type, and additional metadata required for privacy tracking.
