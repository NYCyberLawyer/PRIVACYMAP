# WebAPP - Milestone 1

## Description

The deliverable in this stage will consist of an interface where users are led through an adaptive questionnaire to help them identify all data sources of data (e.g. vendors, applications, website, etc..), as well as the types of data and treatment of that information throughout the business life cycle. The result will be a data flow map with drag and drop flexibility to be modified for any developments that may impact privacy throughout the organization.  This data flow map will comprise one module in the privacy mapping dashboard. Furthermore, at each stage, users will identify the databases, servers, and other sources of data, which, in turn, will facilitate the next Milestone(s).
