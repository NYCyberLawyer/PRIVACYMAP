# Audit / Report Generation - Milestone 3

## Description

Regulators often require that companies owning, managing, or sharing sensitive information must be able to generate a data flow map, as well as a corresponding Privacy Risk Assessment and Privacy Impact Assessment. This step will involve an additional set of questions for Users (e.g. type of report to generate) and provide users the ability to generate / auto-populate reports in PDF or Word format that correspond to those reporting requirements.  (Such reports conducted by consultants often cost at least $8,000 USD per report or update).  These types of reports are in a "Privacy Rules Engine" where various law / audit firms or other organizations (e.g. ISACA, IAPP) can generate / upload their own breakdown of legal requirements and compete for recognition as the authority on that rule or regulation. The reporting requirements for each report generated will be kept up-to-date through that open source privacy rules engine.  As the privacy maps are updated, so will the content of the reports, informing users that a new version of the report is available and thus ensuring that all generated privacy reports are up-to-date date.
